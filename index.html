            <p class="lead">The purpose of this user study is to evaluate how well our system can determine your view towards various entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) based on the articles you read. Our system will periodically download articles from your history and process them locally on your computer. <strong>We do not receive any of this information.</strong> </p>
            <p class="lead">
            You will then submit a survey each week of how well the system identifies your view towards certain entities. No personal information will be sent in the survey, only the scores of how well the system performs will be sent. </p>
            <p class="lead">
            The ultimate goal is to develop a local application that can inform a user of what can be learned from their personal information. The application could then recommend steps to preserve neutrality/anonymity.    </p>

            <h2>What Data will be Accessed?</h2>
  
            <p class="lead">When the application first launches it will create a folder in your home directory called "com.stony-brook.nlp.privacy-project". It will copy your chrome history to this folder and download the articles from your history links periodically (the application should consume little CPU as it is designed to sleep often). The application will store all data in this folder and no where else. The application will require internet access to download the articles from your history. All data will be processed locally on your computer and <strong>no data will be sent to us.</strong></p>

            <p class="lead">When you are ready to send us a survey for the week, you will press the "Open Dashboard" button which will open a web interface locally in your browser. From there you will press the "Start Survey" button and follow the instructions. We will receive the survey using a standard "Google Survey" form. No personal information will be sent, only the scores of how well the system performed. Furthermore, you will be able to see the data we will be receiving when you open the Google Survey.</p>

1. WHAT IS THIS FORM?

This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participating in this research study.

2. WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE?

To participate, you must be at least 18 years of age and read online articles (news, blogs, etc.) for at least 30 minutes each day on average. You will also need to use the Google Chrome Browser on your Mac (Sierra OS or higher) or Windows PC (Windows 10) and have your chrome history available. If your history is already cleared, that is okay, just make sure not to clear it during the study period. You must also have an internet connection for the system to download the articles from your history. We will not receive any of your history data.

3. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?

The purpose of our research study is to improve user privacy and evaluate how well our system can determine your view towards various entities (people, places, organizations, etc.) based on the articles you read. The ultimate goal is to develop a local application that can inform a user of what can be learned from their personal information. The application could then recommend steps to preserve neutrality/anonymity.

4. WHERE WILL THE STUDY TAKE PLACE AND FOR HOW LONG?

This is a completely offline study. We ask that you provide us feedback each week for 1 month through the use of a survey.

5. WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO?

If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to do the following: 

      1. Send us an email to mbastan@cs.stonybrook.edu letting us know you would like to participate so we can keep track of who is participating. You are allowed to use an email that does not have any identifiable information if you want, just be sure to use the same email when submitting the survey.

      2. Read and agree to this consent form. 

      3. Download and install the application on your personal computer. 

      4. Provide feedback each week by pressing the "Start Survey" button. We will receive the survey using a standard "Google Survey" form. No personal information will be sent, only the scores of how well the system performed. Furthermore, you will be able to see the data we will be receiving when you open the Google Survey. 

6. CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?

If at any moment you want to stop the study or you finished the study, then simply press the "uninstall button" in the dashboard and follow the instructions. You can also manually uninstall by following the instructions on the website here: https://richs02.github.io/Privacy-Project-Webpage/#uninstall

7. WILL YOU COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR SENSITIVE INFORMATION DURING THE STUDY?

No personal or sensitive information will be collected. When the application first launches it will create a folder in your home directory called "com.stony-brook.nlp.privacy-project". It will copy your chrome history to this folder and download the articles from your history links periodically over the internet. The application will store all data in this folder and nowhere else. All data will be processed LOCALLY on your own computer and NO DATA WILL BE SENT TO US.

When you are ready to send us a survey for the week, you will press the "Open Dashboard" button which will open a web interface locally in your browser. From there you will press the "Start Survey" button and follow the instructions. We will receive the survey using a standard "Google Survey" form. No personal information will be sent, only the scores of how well the system performed. Furthermore, you will be able to see the data we will be receiving when you open the Google Survey.

8. WILL I RECEIVE ANY PAYMENT FOR TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?

The subjects will receive a $20 Amazon gift card after successfully participating in the study for one month. Successful participation is defined as completing a survey at the end of each week and providing feedback about the correctness of the sentiment prediction on the top entities. The research also has potentially huge benefits in terms of user privacy. 

9. WHAT ARE MY RISKS?

We are taking several measures to ensure your risks are minimized:

     a. The system handles all processing on your own computer. Articles will be downloaded from over the internet on your own computer from the URLs in your history. No data is sent to us other than the survey which you will manually submit each week.

     b. The survey will ask you to answer if our system correctly predicted your view towards various entities. You will then submit the scores of the system through the use of a Google Form. No personal information will be sent, only the scores of how well the system performed. Furthermore, you will be able to see the data we will be receiving when you open the Google Survey.

     c. You can stop participating in the study at any time and the application is very easy to stop and uninstall.

     d. The application runs at the user-level and does not run as a service in the background, so you can easily tell that the system is running. It also sleeps often to consume fewer CPU resources. 

     e. Our system is completely open source and open for inspection here: https://github.com/RichS02/PrivacyProjectApp

10. HOW LONG WILL THE STUDY LAST?

The study lasts 1 month. You will need to send us a survey each week using the "Start Survey" button. At the end of the survey, simply follow the uninstall instructions. You should also email us at mbastan@cs.stonybrook.edu so that we know that you are finished with the study.

11. WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?

Take as long as you like before you make a decision. We will be happy to answer any questions you have about this study. If you have further questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, please contact the researchers at mbastan@cs.stonybrook.edu.
